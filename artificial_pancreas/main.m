Insulin Goals:
1) Very Low BG : <54 mg/dL
2) Low BG :  54-72 mg/dL
3) Mid BG :  72-180 mg/dL
4) High BG :  180-250 mg/dL
5) Very High BG : >250 mg/dL

Carbohydrate Coverage Ratio (CCR):
1) CCR = 500 รท Total Daily Insulin Dose
2) Total Daily Insulin Dose = Insulin Resistance Coeficent(IRC) * Weight
3) IRC(norm) = 0.55 | IRC(lower) < 0.55 | IRC(higher) > 0.55
4) CCR = Average Daily Carbs Consumption / (IRC*Weight)
ex) CCR = 500/(0.55*80)

TOTAL BGL INCREASE FROM MEAL = (CHO / CCR) * 50;

To set custom carbs intake (optional):
@EX: test_data = cho_intake(
            dbname, 
            [50 50 50 50 50], 
            [40 240 440 640 840], 
            "overwrite"
        );

To run for all databases
    for i = 1:size(fname,2)
        DIABETIC_PATIENT(weight, fname(i), version, path(i), randomize)
    end
